# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation

***

**Project Title:** Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Application

**Overview**

This project implements a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables users to ask questions and receive informative answers derived from uploaded PDF documents. The core components of the application include:

* **Streamlit:** Provides the frontend GUI for user interaction.
* **PyPDF2:**  Handles the extraction of text from PDF documents.
* **Langchain:**  Facilitates text processing, embedding, and conversational AI capabilities.
* **Hugging Face Models:** Leverages state-of-the-art language models for embeddings and text generation.

**Key Features**

* **PDF Upload and Processing:** Users can upload multiple PDF documents, which are then processed for answer generation.
* **Question Answering:** The system can handle natural language queries and provide informative answers based on the uploaded documents.
* **Contextual Understanding:** The RAG model leverages document embeddings to retrieve relevant information and generate contextually accurate responses.

**Approach**

1. **Preprocessing**
   * **PDF Text Extraction:** PyPDF2 extracts the raw text content from uploaded PDF files.
   * **Text Chunking:** The Langchain `CharacterTextSplitter` divides the text into smaller chunks for efficient embedding and retrieval.

2. **Embedding Generation**
   * **Instructor-XL Embeddings:**  The Hugging Face `hkunlp/instructor-xl` model creates dense vector representations (embeddings) of the text chunks. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.
   * **FAISS Vector Store:**  The embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector store for optimized retrieval.

3. **Conversational AI**
   * **Google Flan-T5-XXL LLM:** The Hugging Face `google/flan-t5-xxl` language model generates text responses based on retrieved information.
   * **ConversationalRetrievalChain:** Langchain's `ConversationalRetrievalChain` coordinates:
      * Retrieval of relevant text chunks from the vector store based on a user's query.
      * Contextual answer generation using the retrieved information and the LLM.
   * **Conversation Buffer Memory:** Maintains the conversation history for context awareness.

**Usage**

1. **Install dependencies:** 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Upload PDF documents.**

4. **Ask questions and get informative answers!**

**Important Note**

* The accuracy of the answers depends on the quality and relevance of the uploaded PDF documents.

**Future Improvements**

* Incorporate visualization techniques to enhance the representation of the question-answering process.
